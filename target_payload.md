# Problem - Target + Payload
![Target](https://media.giphy.com/media/10iFFpLLpsDm0/giphy.gif)

Write a method that takes two parameters, payload and target. Search through a payload of unique integer values (positive, negative, or 0) to find any two numbers that add together to equal the target (which could also be positive or negative or 0).

When you find a set of numbers that add up to your target value, you can stop processing.

If found, return an array of those two values, otherwise return an empty array if no matching values are found.

For example, if your payload of numbers contained a 10 and a 5 you could return those numbers if your target was 15. Likewise, if you had -3 and 18, those would also add together to be a target of 15.

Be careful that you don't find the same number twice in your payload; for example if your payload contains a 4 and your target is 8, your answer should not indicate that it found 4 twice.

Solve this any way you can, then optimize to run in O(n) time and 1x space complexity.
