![Integers](https://media.giphy.com/media/APqEbxBsVlkWSuFpth/giphy.gif)

You have three arrays of equal size -- each has 1 million RANDOM integer values.

Each array is already sorted in ascending order. No individual array has any duplicate values.

Write a method that returns an array of any/all values which are present in all three arrays.

Solve this any way you can, then optimize to run in O(n) time and 1x space complexity.
